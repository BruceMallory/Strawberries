# My GOAL
My overall goal is to create a data.frame that will allow me to look at the type of chemical application (fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, or fertilizer) and examine per acre applications in selected states during selected years.

# MY STEPS

##  (1) Read and examine
These data were collected from the USDA database selector: <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov">https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov</a>

The data were <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/D416E96E-3D5C-324C-9334-1D38DF88FFF1">stored online</a> and then downloaded to a CSV file.

The data has 21 columns.

```{r echo=FALSE}
ag_data <- read_csv("berries.csv", col_names = TRUE)

colnames(ag_data)
```

## (2) Remove NA columns
After removing all the columns that only had NAs in them, I had these 12 columns.
```{r echo=FALSE}

NA_cols <- which(sapply(ag_data, function(x)all(is.na(x))))

ag_data %<>% select(-all_of(NA_cols))

colnames(ag_data)
```

## (3) Remove the columns that provide no new information
"Program" and "Geo Level" have only 1 value.  And "State ANSI" adds no new information to "State"

This leaves 8 columns.
```{r echo=FALSE}

uni_cols <- sapply(ag_data,function(x) length(unique(x)))
ag_data %<>% subset(select=uni_cols>1)
#note - I could have done this at the beginning to also get rid of the NAs and 
#skipped the previous chunk of r code.  But I wanted to play with removing NAs.

ag_data %<>% select(-`State ANSI`) 

colnames(ag_data)
```

## (4) Filter for 'Strawberries' and 'Year'
NOTE: The Period column has three values: 'MARKETING YEAR', 'YEAR', and 'YEAR - AUG FORECAST.'  I am only keeping the records where Period = 'YEAR' so that we have a consistent comparison.  After filtering, I removed the "Period" and "Commodity" columns.

This leaves 6 columns.
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw <- ag_data %>% filter((Commodity=="STRAWBERRIES") & (Period=="YEAR"))
straw %<>% select(-c(Period, Commodity))

colnames(straw)
```

## (5) In the "Domain" column filter out the unecessary records
In the "Domain" column these are the unique entries:
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw$'Domain' %>% unique
```
Before filtering out all the records where Domain=='TOTAL' I checked to see what information was in those records in the "Data Item" column and in the "Domain Category" column.
```{r}
d_total <- filter(straw, Domain=="TOTAL")
d_total$`Data Item` %>% unique()
d_total$`Domain Category` %>% unique()
```
## (6) From the "Data Items" column filter the useful records
In this column there were 5 unique entries
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw$'Data Item' %>% unique
```
I made a table to see which of these categories had the most information for me to use.  This is the table:
```{r echo=FALSE}
what <- data.frame(table(straw$'Data Item'))
kable(head(what, n=5)) %>% kable_styling(font_size=8)
```
Since the frequencies were almost identical, I decided to use the one that made the most sense to me: "LB/ACRE/YEAR on average."  I then filtered in these rows and deleted the "Data Item" column, and renamed the "Value" column to be "Avg lb/acre/yr."  This is the head of the data.frame so far:
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw %<>% filter(straw$'Data Item'=="STRAWBERRIES, BEARING - APPLICATIONS, MEASURED IN LB / ACRE / YEAR, AVG") %<>%
  select(-('Data Item')) 
colnames(straw)[5] <-"Avg lb/acre/yr"
# I tried colnames(straw)$'Data Item' and other variations, but I couldn't get the code to
# be more general that specifically renaming column 5.  Is there a way?
kable(head(straw, n=5)) %>% kable_styling(font_size=10) %>% column_spec(4, width="15em")
```
### (7) Create an "Application" column.
To do this I first separated the "Domain" column and kept just the back end of each of the entries.  I relabeled this column "Application."  This gave me the following unique entries in the "Application" column:
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw %<>% separate(Domain, c("D_left", "D_right"), sep = ", ") %>% 
  select(-('D_left'))
colnames(straw)[3] <-"Application"
straw$'Application' %>% unique

```
Then I needed to see if all of the NAs in the "Application" column were when a 'FERTILIZER' was used.  To do this I wrote a loop that checked each row to see if, when the entry in "Application" was = NA the "Domain Category" contained 'FERTILIZER.'  There were 15 instances, so I concluded that I could replace the NAs in the "Application" column with "FERTILIZER" and delete the "Domain Category" column.
```{r echo=TRUE}
n<-length(straw$Application)
x<-0
for (i in (1:n)) {
  if((straw$Application[i]=="NA")|(is.na(straw$Application[i])) & (str_detect(straw$`Domain Category`[i], "FERTILIZER"))) {
    x<-x+1
  }
}

print(x)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
straw %<>% select(-("Domain Category")) 
straw$Application <- factor(straw$Application)
#revalue(straw$Application, c("FUNGICIDE"="Fungicide", "HERBICIDE"="Herbicide",
#                             "INSECTICIDE"="Insecticide", "OTHER"="Fertilizer"))
#This was my first attempt, but I couldn't figure out how to get it to NOT print out
#all 560 straw$Application entries when it ran.  So I did the following:

levels(straw$Application)[levels(straw$Application)=="OTHER"]<-"FERTILIZER"
```
Finally, I filtered out the records where "Application" contained 'OTHER,' and where "Avg lb/acre/yr" contained (NA) or (D).  This got me down to 225 records. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
straw %<>%  filter(Application != "OTHER")
straw %<>% filter(straw$"Avg lb/acre/yr" != "(D)")
straw %<>% filter(straw$"Avg lb/acre/yr" != "(NA)")
```
# MY FINAL PRODUCT (n=225): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(straw, n=5)) %>% kable_styling(font_size=12)
```
